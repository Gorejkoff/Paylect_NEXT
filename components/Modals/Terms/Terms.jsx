                balance in your Account will be delivered to you or your digital currency

                Account and/or hold your Digital Assets as appropriate to protect us against
                financial and/or legal liability. If you are later determined to be entitled
                to some or all of the Digital Assets in dispute, we will transfer such Digital
                Assets to you. You will remain responsible and liable for all obligations

                Paylect has no control over the software protocols that govern or constitute

                underlying software protocols relating to any of the Digital Asset available

                (hereafter “<b>fork</b>”) or distribution of Digital Asset (“<b>airdrops</b>
                ”), and such forks or airdrops may materially affect the value, function
                and/or the name of the virtual currencies that are exchanged or acquired

              </p>
              <p>
                Paylect will use reasonable endeavors to provide you with notice of forks or
                airdrops by publishing such a notice on the Website, including, to the extent
                possible, whether Paylect intends to support airdrops, either or both branches
                of a fork, and you agree that you will read such notices to decide in that
                respect. However, we have no obligation to support any specific forks,
                airdrops, or similar distribution events.
              </p>

                It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of, and consider how to deal
                with, upcoming forks or airdrops, including whether to give us instructions
                for the withdrawal of the balance of any Digital Assets. In the event of a
                fork or airdrop, there is a risk that Paylect may need to temporarily suspend
                operations about that fork or airdrop without providing advance notice to you.
                Paylect may, in its reasonable discretion, decline to support either or both
                branches of a fork or airdrop.
