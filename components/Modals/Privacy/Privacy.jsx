            LEGAL GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
            <div className={stylesModal['modal__list-offset']}>
              <p>
                Any operation related to the processing of personal data must have a legal
                basis for the processing. We collect any data only on lawful grounds and only
                data that is necessary to provide our Services to you. We use the main four
                grounds to process your personal data: consent, contract, legal obligation,
                and legitimate interests.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Consent</b> – freely given, informed, and unambiguous indication of your
                wishes to the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose which
                signifies agreement to the processing of personal data.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Contract</b> – a legal ground for the processing of the personal data
                necessary for us to perform a contract or the Terms of Service to which you
                are a party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into
                the contract or the Terms of Service.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Legal obligations</b> – a legal ground for the processing of personal data
                when there is an obligation to comply with a legal obligation to which we are
                subject;
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Legitimate Interests</b> – a legal ground for the processing of personal
                data when it is based on our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests
                of a third party, provided that those interests are not outweighed by your
                rights and interests and those interests have a specific purpose, they are
                necessary, and they are balanced.
              </p>
              <p>
                Applicable laws have other legal grounds for the processing and when they are
                applicable we will use such grounds to process the personal data.

                applicable law, such as public databases, credit bureaus, ID verification

                such information to comply with our internal policies, such as anti-money
                laundering (AML) laws, which is our lawful basis for processing, and to
                provide you with our Services. In some cases, we can process additional data

                communicated to you once you decide to apply for any of our Services that
                require verification of identity and ongoing monitoring of activity. Please
                keep in mind that in some cases we may require additional details and

                prevention purposes.

                We have implemented appropriate technical, procedural, and organizational
                security measures designed to protect the security of any personal data we
                process. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and
                attacks. Your information is stored on secure servers. We restrict access to
                your personal data to those employees who are trained and instructed, have a
                business reason to access, and have professional skills that allow them to
                work with your personal data. Access control and encryption are the key
                technologies for protecting data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, data passing over networks, including the Internet, are
                encrypted with HTTPS, security audits, and other technologies. In addition,
                data is encrypted when it is stored or 'at rest' within servers and hard
                drives as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
                electronic transmission over the Internet and information storage technology
                can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise and guarantee that
                hackers, cybercriminals, or unauthorized third parties will not be able to
                defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
                information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, the
                transmission of personal data to and from our Website is at your own risk. You
                should only access the Website within a secure environment.
